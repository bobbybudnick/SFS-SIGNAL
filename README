This is an example signal indicator for Linux cellular devices.

I did not find such a simple icon for cellular networks but there were 
several available for wifi.  Rather than take the time to adapt one I 
decided it would be more simple to do it myself.

A minimal amount was written in Python for the systray icon itself and the 
rest was written with shell scripting.

Instructions
-----
1. copy files into your home directory
2. run bash component with: ./BASH_COMPONENT
3. run python component with python PYTHON_COMPONENT.py

Troubleshooting
-----
Icon does not show up at all - check required libraries
signal bar does not match up with modemmanager readout - check permissions
Strange icon shows up - check modemmanager operation
